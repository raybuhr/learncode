    "4. Treat if-statements like paragraphs, where each if-elsif-else grouping is like a set of sentences. Put blank lines before and after.\n",

    "\n",
    "Hashes are another example of a data structure, and like arrays they are one of the most commonly used data structures in programming. A hash is used to map or associate things you want to store to keys you need to get them. Again, programmers don't use a term like \"hash\" for something that doesn't work like an actual hash full of words, so let's use that as our real world example.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's say you want to find out what the word \"Honorificabilitudinitatibus\" means. Today you would simply copy-paste that word into a search engine and then find out the answer, and we could say a search engine is like a really huge super complex version of the Oxford English Dictionary (OED). Before search engines what you would do is this:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Go to your library and get \"the dictionary\". Let's say it's the OED.\n",
    "2. You know \"honorificabilitudinitatibus\" starts with the letter 'H' so you look on the side of the book for the little tab that has 'H' on it.\n",
    "3. Then you'd skim the pages until you are close to where \"hon\" started.\n",
    "4. Then you'd skim a few more pages until you found \"honorificabilitudinitatibus\" or hit the beginning of the \"hp\" words and realize this word isn't in the OED.\n",
    "5. Once you found the entry, you'd read the definition to figure out what it means.\n",
    "\n",
    "This process is nearly exactly the way a hash works, and you are basically \"mapping\" the word \"honorificabilitudinitatibus\" to its definition. A hash in Ruby is just like a dictionary in the real world like the OED."

    "### Modules Are Like Hashes\n",
    "This means we have a very common pattern in Ruby:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Take a key=value style container.\n",
    "2. Get something out of it by the key's name.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the case of the hash, the key is a string and the syntax is `[key]`. In the case of the module, the key is an identifier, and the syntax is `.key`. Other than that they are nearly the same thing.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Classes Are Like Modules\n",
    "You can think about a module as a specialized hash that can store Ruby code so you can access it with the `.` operator. Ruby also has another construct that serves a similar purpose called a class. A class is a way to take a grouping of functions and data and place them inside a container so you can access them with the `.` operator.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Objects are Like Require\n",
    "If a class is like a \"mini-module,\" then there has to be a similar concept to `require` but for classes. That concept is called \"instantiate\", which is just a fancy, obnoxious, overly smart way to say \"create.\" When you instantiate a class what you get is called an object.\n"
